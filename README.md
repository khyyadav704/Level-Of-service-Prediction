# Level-Of-service-Prediction
As a Civil Engineering student and tech enthusiast, I created this project to combine my core domain knowledge with machine learning. The aim is to predict the Level of Service (LOS) — a key indicator of traffic performance — using a Multiple Linear Regression algorithm.
This model analyzes various roadway and traffic features to estimate LOS, helping in traffic assessment and urban planning.

Key Highlights:

1)Application of ML in a civil engineering context
2)Data preprocessing and feature selection
3)Model built using Multiple Linear Regression
4)Performance evaluated using R² score and RMSE
5)Visual insights into prediction results
